## Vision

1. **Visualize** graphs as mechanical linkages in 3D space
2. **Analyze** rigidity properties through matrix computations
3. **Explore** dimension folding—finding minimal dimensional subspaces for linkage configurations
4. **Discover** connections between graph theory, rigidity theory, and matroid theory

## Core Research Goal: Path-Connectedness in Configuration Space

The ultimate aim of this project is to answer the **dimension folding problem**:

> Given a linkage in ℝᵈ, find the minimal dimension ℝᵏ (k ≤ d) into which it can be continuously deformed while preserving edge lengths.

### Mathematical Formulation

1. **Configuration Space**: C = {p : V → ℝ³ | ||p(u) - p(v)|| = L(e) for all edges e}
   - C is a real algebraic variety (intersection of sphere level sets)
   - For simple graphs, C ≈ product of spheres with constraints

2. **Dimension Strata**: C_k ⊂ C = configurations whose vertices span a k-dimensional affine subspace
   - C_1 ⊂ C_2 ⊂ C_3 = C (nested subsets)
   - "Folded" configurations lie in C_1 or C_2

3. **The Question**: For a configuration p ∈ C_3, is there a continuous path in C from p to C_1 or C_2?
   - This is a **path-connectedness** question
   - If yes, the path IS the folding animation
   - If no, the linkage cannot fold to lower dimension

4. **Special Points**: The minimal-dimension configurations are "special points" in C
   - These are the targets for our folding paths
   - They may lie on singular loci of the configuration variety

### What We're Building

1. **Visualize C** through the constraint spheres and intersection circles
2. **Navigate C** through the folding animations (paths in C)
3. **Find special points** by computing folding paths to minimal dimension
4. **Analyze path-connectedness** to determine if folding is possible

- Each transformation is typed: "Rigid" (translate/rotate) or "Internal DOF" (uses flexibility)
- Arc paths are drawn on constraint spheres showing the configuration space trajectory
- Animation interpolates along sphere arcs (not linear), preserving constraints

- Goal: Find path in C from generic point to C_k for minimal k

**Key Insight**: The spheres we already visualize ARE the configuration space! The folding motion is a path through this space. The intersection circles show where constraints overlap.

## Current Priority: Phase 7 - Configuration Space Exploration

Phases 3-5 have substantial progress. The next frontier is **understanding and visualizing the configuration space** to find dimension-folding paths.

> **Mathematical Foundation**: See [MATH.md](./MATH.md) for the rigorous theory of configuration spaces, the tangency-collinearity theorem, and fiber bundle structure. This provides the theoretical basis for visualization design.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Add Configuration Space Panel**
   - Explain the product/intersection structure for current graph
   - Show how spheres and circles represent the configuration space

2. **Pin Node Functionality**
   - Let user fix a node and see how it constrains others
   - Visualize the fiber structure of the configuration space

3. **Special Points Detection**
   - Identify configurations at minimal dimension
   - Highlight when current config is a "special point"

4. **Path-Connectedness Tools**
   - Visualize folding paths as trajectories through configuration space
   - Detect when folding is impossible (disconnected components)

## Success Metrics

| Phase | Success Criteria |
|-------|------------------|
| Phase 3 | Edge lengths preserved during animation within 0.1% tolerance |
| Phase 4 | Correctly classify K₃ as rigid in ℝ², K₁,₂ as flexible |
| Phase 5 | Successfully fold K₁,₂ from ℝ² to ℝ¹ |
| Phase 6 | User can create arbitrary graph and analyze its rigidity |

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Type Safety**: Several `@ts-expect-error` comments in graph utilities
2. **Performance**: Sphere geometry recreation on each update (should reuse geometry)
3. **Testing**: No automated tests for mathematical computations
4. **Accessibility**: Fixed canvas sizes, needs responsive design
